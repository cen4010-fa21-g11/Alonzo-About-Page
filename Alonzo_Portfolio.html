My name is Jamesly Celestin and I am a third year Computer Science student. I graduated from the Deerfield Beach High School
When I'm not in school, i'm either at the gym or working on side projects. I plan on receiving my BA and from there jump right into action working at a nice company.

I am the owner of the Your Average Programmer YouTube channel which I started in February 2020. Here I teach people how to code in C# along with some analysis on different algorithms. I haven't posted in a while due to major focus on personal development
I've done a bit of freelancing on the side building websites with WordPress. One of the websites i've built was for my church Bateau Celeste
