<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Alonzo Velez of group 11. I'm a third year student at Florida Atlantic University
studying for a degree in computer engineering. I've taken classes in C and C++ and am teaching myself
HTML,CSS and Javascript to improve my portfolio and help myself in software engineering. My hobbies
mostly consist of playing video games with friends.
